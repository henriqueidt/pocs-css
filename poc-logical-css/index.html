      <h1>POC Logical CSS</h1>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            When declaring CSS, we can use logical properties to ensure our
            views are adaptable to different writing modes as screens. The
            properties are set with logic, rather than physical directions and
            dimensions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we are used to regular languages, like portuguese and english,
            which are written from left to right, top to bottom, there are
            languages that do not follow that standard. For those languages, it
            isn't enough to just translate the texts, we also need to adapt the
            UIs to their writting pattern.
